### Requirements:
- Elm

### Running:
It is easiest to run via `elm reactor`.

### Usage:
It only has note/triad randomizer for now. Press `Space` to change. `T` toggles the triad.

### Known Issues:
Some triads may be composed of differing accidentals. (E.g. Eb-G-A# for Eb triad, rather than Eb-G-Bb)
